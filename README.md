# vma_recall_fMRI

This code runs the recall version of the visuomotor association (VMA) task for functional MRI. The 
code requires the input from a high-speed (60+ Hz) webcam (preferably in the MRI suite) that tracks a 
user's kinematics by detecting a red colored patch afixed to the index or middle finger of a participant.

This version of vma_recall_fmri is custom-built for the Brain Imaging Center (BIC) at the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, Yale University.
